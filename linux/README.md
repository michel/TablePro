# TablePro Linux

Native Linux database client. Sister product to the macOS TablePro app, sharing no code but matching the feature set.

## Status

Phase 0 — foundation. The technology stack was validated by a 2-day spike in April 2026: Rust + GTK4 + libadwaita + sqlx + GtkColumnView built and scrolled 100,000 rows with no perceptible lag. Real codebase scaffolding has not started yet.

## Stack

| Layer | Pick |
|---|---|
| Language | Rust 1.92+ |
| GUI toolkit | GTK4 4.14+ + libadwaita 1.5+ |
| App architecture | [Relm4](https://relm4.org) — Elm-style components on gtk4-rs |
| Async | tokio (DB drivers) bridged to glib main loop (UI) |
| DB drivers | sqlx (PG / MySQL / SQLite), fred (Redis), official mongodb crate, clickhouse-arrow, etc. |
| Persistence | libsecret (passwords), gio::Settings (prefs), JSON files (connection metadata) |
| Distribution | Flathub primary, .deb / .rpm / AppImage secondary |

## What this is not

| Not | Why |
|---|---|
| A port of the macOS app | Swift code does not run on Linux, and Swift / GTK bindings are immature. The Linux app shares zero source with macOS. |
| A plugin host | Drivers are statically linked at compile time. Adding a database engine = adding one crate + one register call. See [decisions/0001-no-plugin-system.md](docs/decisions/0001-no-plugin-system.md). |
| Cross-platform | Linux only. macOS and iOS have separate apps in this monorepo. |
| Electron / WebView | Native GTK4 widgets throughout. No HTML rendering of any kind. |

## Quickstart

System dependencies:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libssl-dev libsecret-1-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install -y gcc pkg-config gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel openssl-devel libsecret-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel pkg-config gtk4 libadwaita openssl libsecret
```

Verify the right versions are present:

```bash
pkg-config --modversion gtk4 libadwaita-1   # need 4.14+ / 1.5+
rustc --version                              # need 1.92+
```

Build and run (once `crates/app/` exists):

```bash
cd linux
cargo run -p tablepro-app
```
